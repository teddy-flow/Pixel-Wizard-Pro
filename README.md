# Pixel Wizard Pro - Image Processing Tool

Pixel Wizard Pro is a versatile image processing tool designed to simplify the preparation of images for advanced computer vision tasks like Gaussian splatting and photogrammetry. This powerful tool enables you to crop and overlay images, ensuring that they seamlessly fit the aspect ratio of other images in your dataset.

## Features

- Crop and resize images to a specified aspect ratio, ensuring compatibility with your existing dataset.
- Overlay images to create a consistent scene or object perspective, making them suitable for Gaussian splatting and photogrammetry applications.
- Customize the final dimensions of your images for precise data alignment.
- Easy-to-use interface with prompts for user input, making the image processing workflow straightforward.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already. You can do this using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python process_images.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information:
   - Enter the path to the folder containing the images.
   - Specify the final aspect ratio by cropping or overlaying.
   - Customize the final dimensions (width x height) of your images.
   
5. The processed images will be saved in a new folder named "new" within the input folder, ready for advanced computer vision tasks.

## Example

Suppose you have a dataset of images with varying aspect ratios, and you want to prepare them for Gaussian splatting or photogrammetry. Pixel Wizard Pro can help you:

1. Enter the path to the folder containing the images (e.g., "input_images").
2. Specify the desired aspect ratio by cropping or overlaying.
3. Customize the final dimensions (width x height) of your images.
4. Processed images will be saved in "input_images/new," perfectly aligned with your dataset.
